- You can also use and share the RTutor problem sets similar to the (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) license with one restriction: You are not allowed to use or share the problem sets if you make or plan to make publicly available or provide a link to any solutions of these problem sets. 

The reason for the limitatian is that in my courses the problem sets are relevant to a small extend for the final grade, since this provides much higher motivation for students to solve them. But therefore I don't want the solutions too easily available. If you want to use the problem sets in a course for which you also want to provide the solutions, please send me an email.
